`PortFolio Version 2`  `Misterj936`
  
Hi! I have created a new Portfolio. I havent looking for designs for my portfolio,  
and then this design by [Britanny Chiang](http://mr-branding.blogspot.com/2019/09/website-inspiration-brittany-chiang.html) got my attention. And so I created and rebuilt  
her design from scratch but I tweeked it a little bit.  
  
I used Vue.JS and used its cli ecosystem to build this project.  
With the Help of other Libraries for transitions and others.

If You want to use this project, Please Credit Me, and dont  
forget to Credit the designer as well.
